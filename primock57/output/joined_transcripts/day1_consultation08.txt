328.99819::338.37155::Doctor::Uh , the reason I ask is sometimes stress can be a , contributing factor. Um, you felt, you noticed yourself, find, uh, , life's been more stressful recently. Is that right?

353.97039::360.2583::Doctor::OK, well, normally at this stage I like to proceed to examination, but um, based on your uh, story.
360.2583::374.81207::Doctor::Um, it's difficult. I think that, you know, , you've, essentially the story is you've got a dry itchy rash on your, mainly your hands. you mentioned. Um and your arms which started, perhaps after swimming a few days ago.
374.81207::382.07392::Doctor::Um, but no other symptoms, you're feeling otherwise, well, no fevers, no bleeding or discharge from skin.
375.38571::376.0042::Patient::Yep.
382.07392::388.35894::Doctor::I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis. Um, have you heard of that condition before?
388.86218::389.97983::Patient::I have, yeah.
390.36747::400.25455::Doctor::OK. Um, great. Well I can give you a patient information leaflet about that, which gives a bit more information about the disease, but, um, it, it's something that we can readily treated. Um.
400.25455::405.21347::Doctor::With couple options, we have steroid creams I can give you, um, which will help with the inflammation.
405.21347::411.42437::Doctor::And, uh, something called emollients, which can help with the dry, dry skin.
411.42437::420.76032::Doctor::And that's something you just need to kind of paste on, uh, on to your skin, uh, , throughout the day for the next few days. Um, and hopefully that helps your symptoms.
422.77647::424.71429::Patient::OK, it's cool. Thank you very much.
424.49747::432.2303::Doctor::Um, , you can also try antihistamines, so you can get things over the counter, Piriton, Loratadine, they can sometimes help with the itchiness.
436.14286::437.5::Patient::Yeah, that sounds good.
437.00804::442.50438::Doctor::OK. And um, that's probably what I recommend. Paracetamol on this occasion, wouldn't be helpful.
442.50438::449.43923::Doctor::Um, uh, uh, painkillers wouldn't be helpful , on this occasion, but let's, let's, let's see how the next few days go.
449.43923::453.9053::Doctor::And if it's still not getting better, come back and see me next week, and we can have another look again, at your symptoms.
