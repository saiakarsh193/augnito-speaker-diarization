377.65247::381.27207::Patient::Uh I work uh at a pharmaceutical company.
381.27207::392.76834::Patient::So it's been a, it's been a few years now. Uh it's uh, it's kind of interesting. We're working I'm a, like a kind of project manager. Uh I mean, do you want to, to know more about it?
392.70311::401.82115::Doctor::OK. Uh no no no that's , that's absolutely fine. Um just a couple of questions I want to ask you, which can sometimes affect your symptoms, is, do you smoke at all?
402.88423::403.59602::Patient::No.
403.49476::406.07114::Doctor::No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
404.84783::405.52191::Patient::
407.07263::420.26097::Patient::Uh you know, once in a while I can, I like hanging out with people once in a while. So yeah I'd say a few, a few beers per week. Something like this. Nothing, nothing crazy. I used to drink a lot more when I was younger. But it's been, it's been a while.
418.50167::427.41906::Doctor::OK. OK. OK I've got to say, at this stage I've got to say this sound quality is not uh great. But I will continue because we've come this far. Um
427.41906::433.87255::Doctor::So um, based on everything you mentioned Sarah , I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema. Um
427.5363::427.93732::Patient::
433.87255::439.52416::Doctor::The reason being that you said it was quite itchy. Um it's mainly affecting your chest and your back.
439.52416::451.09372::Doctor::Um and uh, having looked at your skin, uh the the the rash does appear quite familiar. Um you mentioned using steroid creams, yesterday.
441.50725::442.27005::Patient::
451.09372::458.98778::Doctor::Um from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving you a stronger prescription of a of a steroid may be beneficial.
458.98778::465.96792::Doctor::Uh, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today. As well as, I'm going to give you something, some emollients, which helps to moisturize the skin.
459.08688::459.94195::Patient::OK.
462.07238::462.85499::Patient::OK.
465.96792::473.20635::Doctor::Um which use in the bath and shower. And it's definitely worth um using that for the first seven to ten days.
466.20281::467.20281::Patient::OK.
473.20635::476.79576::Doctor::Uh before we make the decision on whether it's working or not.
473.47814::474.24626::Patient::OK.
476.79576::483.23229::Doctor::Um it's also worth um using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over counter.
483.23229::489.38691::Doctor::Things like Loratadine or Piriton, which can help the itchiness of your skin.
487.85489::488.85489::Patient::OK.
489.38691::499.4713::Doctor::And uh, um it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use, in terms of shower gels or soap.
499.4713::503.79752::Doctor::Because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about an eczema CU.
504.01423::509.34754::Patient::OK. Yes, I have tried antihistamines, uh lately, but it didn't really help.
510.41834::512.04086::Doctor::Ohh, could you say that again, sorry?
512.31855::516.75331::Patient::I have tried uh antihistamines, but uh but it didn't really help.
514.23954::514.8753::Doctor::OK.
516.66889::523.29253::Doctor::OK. So it's something for you to think about. you can get different types of antihistamines. I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well.
523.29253::529.61705::Doctor::Um, something like Fexofenadine, which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying, and it's not going to do you any harm.
523.76777::524.36436::Patient::OK.
529.61705::535.03428::Doctor::Um but I think using the steroids and the emollients, um on a regular basis
535.03428::542.90184::Doctor::Uh over the next week to ten days, should hopefully control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week, if things don't get better.
543.59377::544.70971::Patient::That sounds good.
544.70317::547.25947::Doctor::OK? Um do you have any questions for me?
547.84398::555.81111::Patient::Uh, no that's it. Thank you very much. Bye. Thank you as well. Bye.
549.5045::551.23298::Doctor::OK. Well I wish you all the best.
552.66344::553.76278::Doctor::Thank you. Have a good day.
