195.7299::207.03987::Patient::Um, I had a little bit of diarrhea. Um but, but it didn't, it didn't cut my appetite or anything. I just like, my stomach wasn't feeling great.

259.32587::268.20514::Patient::Sometimes I do pilates. But like, it's hurting me so much at the moment. Um so, to be honest, all I feel like doing is just lying in bed.

324.58859::331.84944::Doctor::OK, alright. Who's looking after your diabetes? Is there anyone, is there a doctor in a hospital, who looks after your diabetes?
331.15983::334.47232::Patient::I just regularly go see a doctor.
334.47232::344.41482::Patient::Um, that just checks up on it. Same with the high blood pressure. Like I, I have it under control. And since I've started taking this medication, I've just been like regularly checking that it, it's under control.
334.51301::335.79339::Doctor::
343.95235::349.28086::Doctor::Right, excellent. And in terms of your social situation, who lives at home with you?
349.60387::351.65354::Patient::Uh just, it's just me and my partner.
351.37298::355.79358::Doctor::lives OK, um fine. Is your partner well at the moment?
355.54712::366.52604::Patient::Yeah he has none of this. Like he's just going ahead like, like nothing. Like I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him but, not uh, diarrhea, nothing, fine.
362.32635::364.34506::Doctor::Right, OK. So he
366.34428::371.75127::Doctor::Go away, he's got away with it, at the moment. OK. And uh, are you working at the moment, April?
368.09304::368.60473::Patient::
372.43311::386.89146::Patient::Uh, yeah I am working. But the, the first day I skipped. because I was feeling just too shit. Um, but then, I just felt like had to go back, 'cause I had so much to do. So I've been going in. But it's not been fun.
378.36388::379.36388::Doctor::Yeah.
383.43248::384.27256::Doctor::
386.68026::389.33087::Doctor::No, I can imagine. What is it that you do for work?
390.32212::393.29345::Patient::Uh, I am a developer.
393.46681::399.87809::Doctor::Ohh, so you work in the IT field. OK. IT field. Right, OK. Uh
395.76416::397.78781::Patient::yeah. Work in IT.
398.88786::403.58724::Patient::not too active a job. Uh, yeah.
402.13044::405.00936::Doctor::No. Has it been quite stressful recently?
406.09922::414.27816::Patient::Not more than usual. I don't think it's related to stress. Like I, I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work that way. Um
411.98171::412.65835::Doctor::OK.
414.27317::415.60155::Doctor::The reason I ask is sometimes
414.27816::419.31711::Patient::I've been able to take a day off to try and recover. So yeah, I don't think it's related.
417.89908::427.05613::Doctor::Sure. reason I ask is because sometimes stress can really affect your immune system. Um but uh it's good to know you're you're you're not feeling stressed.
427.05613::429.82474::Doctor::Um, do you smoke at all, April?
430.15278::433.92855::Patient::I used to, but I've stopped for about six months now.
434.41979::437.9074::Doctor::OK. Um and what about alcohol?
438.97525::452.23384::Patient::I mean, yeah I, I don't think I drank that much. Like, I I don't really know how you count the units. So I guess like I don't drink more than like, like, let's say three evenings a week? And I rarely get like properly drunk, or anything.
452.26283::453.9901::Doctor::And what is it that you drink?
454.69377::456.41508::Patient::Wine, mostly.
456.11407::458.8992::Doctor::The wine. How much do you drink on those nights?
459.47372::462.40378::Patient::Uh, I'd say like maybe two or three glasses.
462.85789::471.85911::Doctor::OK. So um, yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of um, the recommended limit.
471.85911::471.87573::Doctor::
472.75879::479.50257::Doctor::Something think about, just in terms of your blood pressure and diabetes, maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can.
479.40582::482.76472::Patient::Yeah? I should cut down on it.
479.50257::481.51911::Doctor::
481.51911::495.00676::Doctor::really ideally, the the the right answer is to cut down completely. But so in practice I know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks, why don't you cut down to two glasses a week. And then, one week thereafter
495.00676::499.40346::Doctor::Um and if you are coping OK, then you can maybe try and cut down altogether.
500.7572::501.4774::Patient::OK.
501.35388::515.66798::Doctor::OK? Just something for you to think about. Um, right so uh just as we wrap up really, um April I think based on your story, I think uh essentially I think you're, you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness. Um, I don't think there's anything to worry about.
503.39007::503.85534::Patient::Yeah.
515.66798::521.22998::Doctor::You know you've had a bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic.
521.22998::530.44489::Doctor::I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been five days. I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better in the next couple of days. It normally lasts for about a week to ten days.
530.57291::535.74246::Patient::What, what should I do if it just keeps going on and on? Like if it's still going on in, in say four days?
535.23003::540.83335::Doctor::Yeah, absolutely. So, you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to, you know get some nice, good rest.
540.83335::545.71766::Doctor::Drink plenty of fluids. Keep yourself well-hydrated. You can take regular Paracetamol.
545.71766::551.87471::Doctor::If you feel like you're still not getting any better in two to three days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again. We can check you over.
551.87471::563.65161::Doctor::And if you are still feeling feverish, um and your cough isn't getting any better, then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest. some of the uh uh common source of infection. Um
563.03781::565.85077::Patient::Do you think I should keep going to work? Or do you think I should just
565.64335::580.42852::Doctor::Yeah so I think you know , really I think it depends on you. it's um if you are coughing, then there is a theoretical, you know risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still. So I would say maybe take a day or two off work, if you can.
580.42852::585.18887::Doctor::Uh and get some good bed rest. Um and maybe think about work early next week.
586.10576::588.63636::Patient::OK. OK. Thank you.
587.6021::593.75914::Doctor::But um, if your cough isn't getting any better, or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner. OK?
593.83021::595.97306::Patient::OK. But otherwise, I don't need to worry.
595.78593::597.91309::Doctor::No no no , nothing to worry about otherwise.
598.25138::600.35612::Patient::OK. Alright. Thank you very much.
598.88402::601.92445::Doctor::OK. Well, have a good day. Appreciate it.
601.79629::603.20641::Patient::Thank you. Bye!
