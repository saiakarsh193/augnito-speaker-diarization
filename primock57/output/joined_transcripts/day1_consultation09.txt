407.14312::416.17107::Doctor::, so socially, OK. All right. Um, right, excellent. So, um, at this stage I , I would proceed to examination.
409.53436::410.70922::Patient::Yeah.
416.17107::426.80413::Doctor::But um, based on your story, um, just to summarise really. So, last three days, you've been having bit of burning pain on passing urine. A bit of, crampy tummy pain lower down.
426.80413::433.78635::Doctor::Um, , essentially but, but no other fevers or back pain, uh, if I, if I understand correctly.
427.05268::428.05268::Patient::
433.78635::444.67869::Doctor::I think probably do have what we call a simple UTI or urinary tract infection, bladder infection, um, which can be readily treated. So, I'll give you a course of antibiotics today.
433.84102::434.84102::Patient::Mm-hmm.
439.50527::440.50527::Patient::OK.
444.67869::454.45894::Doctor::Something, called either Nitrofurantoin, or Trimethoprim. Uh, and it's normally a three day course. Uh, so, one tablet, twice a day, for three days.
444.96514::446.06733::Patient::OK.
454.45894::463.15232::Doctor::And , that should hopefully help your symptoms, but I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Let's try and flush that, you know, that infection out of your body, if you can.
454.717::455.80459::Patient::OK.
463.15232::468.03038::Doctor::Um, you can try, cranberry juice, that can sometimes help with your symptoms.
468.03038::476.27099::Doctor::Um, and if you're still not better, by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me. And uh, we can have another look at your symptoms.
474.33752::475.33752::Patient::
477.14044::484.66602::Patient::OK, so three days of the medication, and then wait a little bit, if it still doesn't go away, call back, that OK?
477.16572::477.9176::Doctor::OK.
482.79731::493.10909::Doctor::Yeah, yeah absolutely. And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of, high temperatures, a back pain, um just , generally feeling more unwell.
493.10909::503.0304::Doctor::Uh, you know, I do want you give me a call back, 'cause then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we wanna avoid. So, do, do give me a call if you're having any concerns, OK.
493.31569::494.49087::Patient::OK.
503.38872::510.47634::Patient::OK, is there, is there anything like, like, should I be worried about? Like, like, not having sex or anything within the next week, or anything like this?
509.78981::525.04736::Doctor::Yeah I mean if you can try and avoid it, I think that'd be sensible. Um, uh, it's great that you're using barrier contraception. I would recommend you to continue using barrier contraception, but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up. That'd probably be the best for you and your boyfriend,.
524.80487::531.19695::Patient::OK, OK. Uh, that, that makes sense. Ohh, OK, thank you so much.
525.73202::527.09809::Doctor::All right.
