96.82066::107.2886::Patient::Uh, I've been trying to, like, take ibuprofen and paracetamol just to from over the counter, but it's not really helping, just been taking the recommended dose every day of those.
107.61344::111.34123::Doctor::Sure, and when you say it's not helping, is it bringing the temperature down at all?
111.86152::117.96931::Patient::Perhaps slightly, yes, but I'm still experiencing these symptoms, so, it does take the edge off a bit.
118.08327::124.72109::Doctor::OK, alright. And can I just double check have you gotten any cough or cold or sore throat or anything like that?

204.58309::205.56036::Patient::
207.70068::220.62786::Patient::It's something that I've struggled with through, years really, just related to a screen use, or, uum, like changes in weather patterns. Yeah, high pressure days, sometimes I struggle with migraines, and headaches.

464.12536::465.12536::Doctor::OK.
466.29332::473.26308::Patient::But I'm, I'm really struggling quite a lot at work at the moment. It's been quite difficult, feeling so, uh, tired all the time.
468.91369::470.8334::Doctor::So, I can .
473.01588::477.9721::Doctor::Sure, OK. Um, and, are you a, uh, are you a smoker at all?
478.28565::479.64092::Patient::No, I'm not.

486.17491::490.38978::Doctor::OK, and how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally?
491.49746::496.54527::Patient::I try and do, uh, some moderate physical exercise a few times a week.
496.74081::500.47917::Doctor::OK, that's good, alright, um, so, um
501.256::509.72401::Doctor::What, uh, I think we're gonna need to do is we're gonna need to bring you into one of our clinics. Examine , and we're gonna need to arrange some blood tests as well.
506.14877::507.01146::Patient::OK.
509.72401::522.91322::Doctor::OK, um, so, what what I want to do is, the first question I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this fever and these symptoms, because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me.
510.72334::511.52758::Patient::OK.
522.91322::529.67298::Doctor::There's no, uh, when someone has got fever and sweats, we want to find out have they got chest infection, have they got a throat infection?
529.67298::536.53753::Doctor::Um, and if we can't find a focus of infection, then that's something, that, that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered, OK?
536.53753::541.75046::Doctor::Um, the second thing, second factor, is that you've recently come from, uh, Vietnam.
536.85813::537.83924::Patient::OK.
541.75046::551.56505::Doctor::And you've had exposure to rural areas. And we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well. So, um, you're probably gonna need some blood tests.
551.56505::554.01613::Doctor::After you've been seen by somebody.
554.01613::562.45708::Doctor::Um, now, the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you, which is why we're going to go, go for the examination first.
562.45708::573.13298::Doctor::You come into one of our clinics in central London, that's one option, and then the the GP there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be.
562.57795::563.46607::Patient::OK.
573.13298::580.61851::Doctor::Or, if it's inconvenient for you to come into central London because you you're living further out, you could actually just attend a local A and E.
580.61851::588.65858::Doctor::I'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of test I think you need in the notes for this appointment, so you could show that to them at reception.
588.65858::592.37667::Doctor::Um, I'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films, to check for malaria.
592.37667::597.89769::Doctor::And inflammatory markers and things like those, technical terms, but they'll understand what that, what I'm talking about.
597.89769::605.68783::Doctor::But, um, I, I don't think you can go into work, uh, until we've sorted this out. And we, we, we need to sort this out sooner rather than later.
605.92592::613.69841::Patient::OK. That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help. I, I think, yeah, I can come straight into central London today to get that sorted.
607.0389::607.74858::Doctor::OK.
613.28639::618.81556::Doctor::OK, fine, so what I'm going to do is I will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in.
618.81556::626.11124::Doctor::And if you can ring the number that I leave in your consultation notes, after a few minutes, and then they'll slot you in, and then we can sort things out from there. OK?
626.53097::628.54019::Patient::That's brilliant. Thank you very much.
628.35754::630.75143::Doctor::Alright then, OK. Take care then. All the best.
630.78903::631.64859::Patient::Goodbye.
631.52012::632.06522::Doctor::Bye.
