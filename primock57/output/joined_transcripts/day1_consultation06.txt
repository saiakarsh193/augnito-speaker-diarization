517.94921::528.84486::Doctor::Um, right. Ohh um, based on your, based on you history, and having listened to your story, I, I wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure, sir. Um,
528.84486::532.98363::Doctor::Which can sometimes happen. Um, um, and uh,
530.08577::530.77026::Patient::Mmm.
532.2634::532.65706::Patient::That.
532.98363::541.20454::Doctor::It's . So, it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be. Um, and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure, there's obviously
533.55503::534.37561::Patient::What's going on.
541.20454::547.636::Doctor::Um, that's the first thing that comes to my mind. Um, now there's a couple of options move forward. Um,
545.10023::545.84308::Patient::Mmm.
547.636::554.71038::Doctor::Given that you're otherwise well at the moment, and having examined you, your chest, and your saturations and blood pressure are all OK,
554.71038::561.88415::Doctor::I'm quite happy to increase your dose of Furosemide. Maybe, rather than one tablet a day, we can do two tablets a day, for the first few days.
562.24535::565.12839::Doctor::Um, and see, and see how you're getting on.
566.30142::568.17512::Patient::OK. If you think that'll be better.
566.91901::567.56009::Doctor::Uh,
568.37219::580.06464::Doctor::I think, I think, it's, it's, it's definitely worth treating your symptoms. But what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test, and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart, to see how well your heart's pumping.
581.27871::582.08565::Patient::OK.
582.46829::591.36774::Doctor::Is that something you've had before? Yeah, so um, an , it's a, it's a general scan of your heart. You might have had this done before, when you were diagnosed. And it's just to get a good
582.99439::583.7668::Patient::What does that?
590.95354::592.07616::Patient::Ohh yes, I remember now.
593.04324::593.77254::Doctor::Sorry?
594.76762::597.36097::Patient::Uh, yeah, I remember now. .
595.80791::604.6319::Doctor::You remember that. OK, fine. That's something I can organize for you today. And, and that might take a week or two weeks for that to be organized. But, I think certainly in the meantime, let's, um,
604.6319::612.6443::Doctor::Let's, let's get a blood test done. We can check your um, you know your full blood count, look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function.
612.6443::620.4561::Doctor::Um, and we can definitely increase your um, your Furosemide, uh, to you know, one tablet twice a day.
620.4561::625.7375::Doctor::But I really like, would like you to come back and see me in about a week's time, see how you're getting on. That sound reasonable?
626.68295::628.02518::Patient::I think that sounds like a good plan.
628.5853::642.0411::Doctor::And of course, in the meantime if you are getting more unwell, feel like you're getting more breathless, or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain, or palpitations or dizziness, then, uh, you know I want you to give me a call sooner than that, and we can have a chat on the phone as well.
643.02608::645.0855::Patient::OK. I'll see how I get on.
645.34993::646.99823::Doctor::OK? Do you have any questions for me?
648.89708::652.07099::Patient::Uh, I think that's all pretty clear. Thank you very much Doctor.
651.85868::656.98958::Doctor::Great, and then well I wish you all the best! Have a good day. OK. Thank you.
654.25629::656.08548::Patient::OK. See you soon.
