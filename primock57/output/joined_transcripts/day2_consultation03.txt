329.26198::330.30709::Doctor::
333.96388::341.13691::Patient::, I guess what I'm trying to think is, you know, is there something particularly serious that, you know, will need to be sorted and.
341.13691::350.95616::Patient::Obviously, really, anything can just make you really frantic . Hopefully nothing , so serious I will die from it, I don't know I just, I think got myself in a pickle.
345.44991::346.04389::Doctor::
348.78073::357.28551::Doctor::OK. so um, uh, obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via the video, uh, portal.
357.18804::358.01412::Patient::Mmm.
357.28551::367.75058::Doctor::um, from what you've told me, this doesn't seem to be you know, anything um, that you're gonna die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today.

375.89817::376.71907::Patient::Yeah.
378.2167::387.87832::Doctor::We can go into that, explaining what that is, if um, if that's confirmed on, on physical examination. But um, that's not usually a life-threatening problem.
384.02859::385.02859::Patient::OK.
387.87832::402.14316::Doctor::But, um, part of the reason why I'd like you to come in, it's just that we can do a, a what we call a, a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on, and confirm that might be the diagnosis. Have a look, have a look inside the ear, see if there's any, , anything to see within the ear.
