446.09669::453.29196::Doctor::Good. So, you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment, and I can understand, they probably feel quite strange and unusual.
453.27957::453.99713::Patient::Yeah.
454.32069::459.97264::Doctor::Um, I think the best course of action is, you come and see, one of our doctors, in the clinic.
459.98673::460.55925::Patient::Yeah.
460.23174::465.20039::Doctor::We can give you an examination, and what that means is, we check your heart and your breathing.

465.61504::468.51247::Doctor::Make sure that those things are functioning correctly.
468.3641::469.00532::Patient::Yeah.

472.11484::472.71026::Patient::Yep.
472.92892::475.17014::Doctor::And take it from there. How does that sound?
475.55792::477.66524::Patient::That sounds, uh, very good. Thank you.
477.34704::481.16695::Doctor::I think before we give you any medications, we should see you in person.

482.10122::490.24412::Doctor::So, what we're going to do is book an appointment. Or I think you can book an appointment through the app, to come and see us clinic, and see one of my colleagues.

488.55417::489.11242::Patient::Yep.
