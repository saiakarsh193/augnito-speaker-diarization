254.0011::263.74027::Doctor::OK and... OK, so uh I, I believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you, yeah?
263.74027::289.55531::Doctor::Um, it it's not possible for us to do that online. I think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination, and I, I think you would need one quite urgently, OK? So the thing that's running in the back of my mind are um, kind of a viral illnesses that can one can get with um, sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel.
263.99686::264.68027::Patient::OK.
289.55531::302.91996::Doctor::Like , um the other common thing around Thailand, it will be like some dengue. But that would have, like you would have some, uh, blood spots or bleeding or something, which you don't have at the moment, do you?
289.68417::290.40938::Patient::OK.
303.00552::310.81304::Patient::Uh no. I mean I've got a bit of a rash, but nothing like, uh no, no, no, no bleeding.
310.40717::313.18979::Doctor::OK. So where is the rash?
313.36627::322.62518::Patient::Um, it's uh, the rash is kind of all over my body. Like it's not, it's not, it's not really localised.
320.10286::324.71158::Doctor::How would you describe, how would you describe the rash?
324.62481::328.50526::Patient::Um uh sort of red and itchy.
329.43623::337.74062::Doctor::Red and itchy. OK. So if you were to put a glass on top of the rash, does that rash go away?
330.9745::331.65465::Patient::Yeah.
337.79419::339.24788::Patient::Uh, yes.
338.94352::340.68265::Doctor::It goes away. OK.
342.48199::362.88566::Doctor::OK. So what we need to do, need to urgently examine you. And that's sometime today. OK? And um, after our examination there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital. But I'm not sure as yet. So I'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible?
347.50239::349.48024::Patient::OK.
362.84715::363.76478::Patient::OK.
362.88566::382.29713::Doctor::So um, I'll recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor, preferably in the next few hours time. OK? And um, in any case if that's not available I'd like you to take yourself to . Alright? Any questions at all?
372.35314::373.20021::Patient::OK.
379.16439::379.99219::Patient::OK.
382.39585::385.05673::Patient::Uh, no. Sounds serious.
385.92925::394.20465::Doctor::, you know obviously when I've spoken to you, you, you didn't tick the box for many theories, but you're in the middle somewhere. Let's put it that way.
394.08805::394.93358::Patient::OK.
394.20465::408.74884::Doctor::Um you know things like we have to rule out is Meningitis and all, but Ben, you just have a general muscle ache. You didn't say that you had things like, you had problems looking at the light or something Those are things when you think of Meningitis
408.74884::436.1034::Doctor::But and then, it's the uh, in meningitis you get a non-blanching rash. While in any kind of virus the rash usually goes away. Saying that, we don't know whether these are the beginning stage. So that's why I'd rather, but I would rather you see a GP as soon as possible, if uh, we've got a slot available. But if not, I think you need to be seen, and maybe have some blood tests and examinations. OK?
435.91965::438.22656::Patient::OK, cool. Thank you very much.
437.92838::441.5828::Doctor::All right, you take care, Ben. Bye now. Cheers. Bye.
439.62781::441.28783::Patient::Bye.
