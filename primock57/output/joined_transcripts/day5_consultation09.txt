225.68599::237.20466::Patient::Um, I, to be honest that actually turns out it was a bit of a sore throat I had, um, so possibly a little bit feverish, but I, I sort of put it down to that.

453.77736::454.94617::Patient::Uh, just my wife.
456.22555::457.406::Doctor::Um.
459.43608::478.20299::Doctor::Sorry, um, so with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels.
478.20299::500.93983::Doctor::Um, I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things, like liver, kidneys, blood count, etc. But also, some more specific things like, um, a bacterial infection you can sometimes get, uh, including one which you can get which can produce a rash like that. So, that would involve blood tests. Are you happy to do that?
482.59224::483.59224::Patient::
501.68104::506.60263::Patient::Uh, yeah, I but, uh, what, what's the infection?
506.82705::518.38344::Doctor::Well, you can get, uh, you can get a bacterial infection caused which is called, um, it's called lyme disease that you can get a rash like that from a tick bite.
518.38344::529.95487::Doctor::So that's something we would do a test for, as well. Um, and if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it.
518.88695::519.78307::Patient::OK.
523.55545::524.41261::Patient::OK.
530.71427::540.1654::Doctor::So it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for which can cause reduced energy, tiredness and aching for, persistent over six weeks.
540.67696::541.50815::Patient::OK.
542.01502::551.57141::Doctor::So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line, and then when you've had the test arrange a follow up about a week after, after you've had the test done.
552.27967::559.63628::Patient::OK, so, do the test first and then, and that follow up we can just do over the phone again? Or, yeah.
558.30073::561.78946::Doctor::Um, yeah, we can do that over the phone to start with.
561.52578::563.12311::Patient::All right. Excellent.
563.1654::564.2857::Doctor::OK?
564.79835::567.15533::Patient::That, that's really helpful, thank you very much.
565.84961::567.43607::Doctor::
568.21376::570.53827::Patient::Oops, sorry, you broke up a bit there.
569.6466::571.15036::Doctor::Any other questions?
571.23312::572.84343::Patient::Ohh, no, not , no.
573.01502::575.31577::Doctor::OK, that's great. Take care.
574.75241::577.31066::Patient::OK, take care, thank you, bye.
577.609::578.99998::Doctor::Sorry
