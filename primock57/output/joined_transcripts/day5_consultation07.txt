293.21582::293.98556::Doctor::OK.
295.2224::300.99868::Doctor::And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms? Anything that you've bought in the chemist?
302.01859::308.49888::Patient::Um, uh, a quite a few lemon sips. Um, they seems to be helping.
306.97233::307.77497::Doctor::
308.58418::312.38021::Doctor::Do you, what, what do you mean by quite a few? How many in, in a day do you normally take?
312.7489::316.59102::Patient::Uh, maybe two or three. Maybe, like, at the start of the day and at the end of the day.
316.88678::319.44598::Doctor::OK. Have you noticed any improvement in that?
320.32129::323.71604::Patient::Yeah. It tends to soothe my throat a bit for when I'm going to sleep.
324.46572::328.32096::Doctor::OK. Um, do you have any allergies to anything?
329.14369::333.64371::Patient::Uh, I sometimes suffer from some, like, hay fever. But, um, but it's not bad
332.242::335.80778::Doctor::Any . Any allergies to any medications at all?
336.05161::337.61082::Patient::Not that I'm aware of, no.
337.82752::358.21594::Doctor::OK. So, what you've described to me, it sounds like you, you probably have got an infection in the chest, um, because it's, it, you know, you're obviously getting symptoms of from your nose and your chest. Um, it sounds like you might have a high temperature, it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature.
358.49908::361.57804::Patient::OK. I can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something?
361.90049::380.10253::Doctor::Yeah, and most of the time, these infections are caused by viruses, so they do normally settle by themselves. But it can take, you know, a week or two, um, and you can persistently have the cough ongoing longer than that.
380.81823::384.10849::Doctor::Um, the important thing to do would be to take your temperature.
384.80648::404.20239::Doctor::Um, and if you feel like, if the temperature's ongoing, above thirty seven point five, thirty eight, um, and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down, or your cough's getting worse, you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out your nose,
404.20239::419.5849::Doctor::um, or any shortness of breath, chest pain, then we certainly would need to speak to you again. With the diabetes you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes, so it's something we do need to be careful of.
411.11116::411.85458::Patient::OK.
420.62436::424.96648::Patient::OK. So, then we would at potentially antibiotics at that time, perhaps?
424.74596::430.77279::Doctor::Yeah, potentially. If it is, if it's not settling or the temperature's ongoing, getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again.
430.92703::431.7165::Patient::OK.
431.77279::435.0211::Doctor::Um, have you got any other questions?
435.63757::438.04547::Patient::Um, no, that's all fine.
437.95558::451.29112::Doctor::It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment, with the lemsip. I wouldn't take, and that, that contains paracetamol so don't take any other paracetamol containing products, um, with that at the same time.
445.79295::446.33111::Patient::Yeah.
451.29112::464.63848::Doctor::Um, the cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime because it's best for your body if you just keep coughing. But if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all, then it, it's OK to have a little bit of cough syrup, just to settle that down.
465.35481::466.5127::Patient::OK. Cool.
467.21566::483.1206::Doctor::OK? Do you have blood sugar checking equipment? Do you check? No, OK. Well, if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GP has asked you for?
468.55876::469.15744::Patient::Yep.
473.11798::474.40746::Patient::I'm not at home.
483.42779::483.94697::Patient::Yeah.
484.32126::489.23998::Doctor::OK, great. Alright then, take care. Bye.
485.05881::485.67723::Patient::
486.73644::489.17998::Patient::Alright. Thanks so much. Bye.
