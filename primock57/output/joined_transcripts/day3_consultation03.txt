454.67791::468.57791::Doctor::OK. Alright. Fine. So, what we need to do, um, just before that, um, just a few more things. Uh, any any past medical history you'd like to share with me today?
468.49504::473.86949::Patient::Uh, yes. I had too little activity of my thyroid, uh.
472.99219::476.09219::Doctor::Sorry you had thyroid problems.

480.71425::484.33892::Patient::Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, and in, in
485.6246::488.13632::Patient::In view of that, I took thyroxine.
487.79219::492.30648::Doctor::Yeah, you're taking thyroxine? Are you using it every day?
489.52913::491.30879::Patient::
493.02894::494.71338::Patient::Uh, not anymore.
494.86362::496.3779::Doctor::Why is that?
496.08833::502.08175::Patient::Uh, I have, I have not been taking it in the last, actually since I changed doctor, I would say.
501.76362::508.0779::Doctor::OK, so is that, so all these things are since you've stopped taking the thyroxine?
508.66439::509.55726::Patient::Ohh.
510.78342::513.90816::Patient::That might be coinciding, I'm not sure about that.
513.70648::516.33505::Doctor::When was your last blood test?
517.05075::519.40177::Patient::Uh, haven't taken one in a long time.
519.16362::521.73505::Doctor::OK, so you've not had a blood test.
521.71113::522.27071::Patient::Mm hmm
522.73505::547.09219::Doctor::Right, OK. It could, you know, generally for you know for underactive thyroids what symptoms you've said um it's the opposite that usually happens, yeah. It's for overactive thyroid like you can feel a bit like the racing of your heart beat and all so I'm not quite clear on what picture we are having here. Yeah?
537.19159::537.89996::Patient::OK.
547.09219::574.36362::Doctor::I think a general set of bloods is a good , good start. So what we look at, because you're not, you're not having the umph, aren't you? You're like, you're just feeling a bit, you know low and things like that, right? Well, um, and weak and things like that. So we'll just do a general set of bloods. we look at things like anaemia, how your kidney functions are, your livers, all that, with vitamin levels, and your .
547.92031::548.70838::Patient::OK.
561.12604::562.24266::Patient::yes.
573.15809::573.92597::Patient::No problem.
574.36362::587.69219::Doctor::OK. And uh, now after we get those set of bloods, we will find out if we can find anything in them. If that's all clear, then we would need to do a physical examination. OK?
575.4021::576.11643::Patient::Uh huh
587.30683::587.92949::Patient::Okay.
587.69219::602.60151::Doctor::We would need to then go in and do . But there's nothing from what your history you've said that, that we urgently warrant a physical examination at this point in time. I think it's a good idea to start off with a blood test, and then take it from there.
588.75995::589.22814::Patient::OK.
602.60151::624.03381::Doctor::Obviously with palpitations or chest pain, if you get that's more of a medical emergency. You need to go to A and E for that. OK? If things change, you've mentioned now your bowels are fine, and you're not being sick. So if that's the case it's OK, but if your, you know, bowels change or you're being sick again, you need to get in touch with us. OK?
622.20033::634.24062::Patient::OK, I have, I haven't been walking lately at all. I haven't, yes. I haven't been walking lately at all so like, it's really hard for me to identify when I feel the shortness of breath.
625.56096::627.83504::Doctor::Sorry? Could you repeat that?
634.12103::634.74192::Doctor::Mm-hmm.
634.24062::644.14427::Patient::Uh, just wanted to add that into , because, um, I haven't been walking. I haven't been feeling good enough for a good at all. So, yep.
643.32589::653.3143::Doctor::OK. So let's do all the blood tests first and we'll take it from there. OK? But you know, if you have any chest pains, or change in bowel habits, do get in touch with us.
646.47149::647.20366::Patient::Thank you.
648.43708::648.90608::Patient::
653.99581::655.25648::Patient::I will, yes.
654.4779::677.54933::Doctor::OK. Now what we need to do is now you need to ring up support. And I'll the form for you, but in the interim you need to call support so that we can organise that blood test for you. And when you get the result, you will receive a text message through your phone to tell you to book an appointment. If you're feeling poorly, don't wait for that. Just get in touch with us again, yeah?
658.42287::658.95865::Patient::Uh huh.
665.6073::666.14848::Patient::
671.83837::673.08833::Patient::OK. Can I
677.19509::679.99844::Patient::I will. How do I call to report?
680.24774::689.36557::Doctor::Ohh, there's a number on your app, yeah? If you open up your app there's the number on there. It's an oh three hundred number, yeah? So just call that number.
687.09887::687.75601::Patient::OK.
689.36669::690.59285::Patient::I will find it, thank you.
690.38202::693.0765::Doctor::Alright then. You take care. Bye now.
693.12242::694.29502::Patient::Thank you, ciao.
694.19313::695.35946::Doctor::Ciao, bye.
