390.59183::393.00761::Patient::Yeah, , days, yeah.
393.5805::410.72965::Doctor::Right, OK. Um, I mean, it sounds like you've had a flare up of your asthma. It could be, um, triggered by, if there's more pollen around, or there may be, you may have a viral infection, causing it to get worse.
409.272::409.93172::Patient::Mm-hmm.
410.77894::411.57755::Patient::Mm-hmm.
411.6401::414.08039::Doctor::Did you say you checked your temperature already?
414.78388::417.74849::Patient::Yes, I checked, I have fever .

426.86837::431.55794::Doctor::OK, that's fine. Um, have you got an asthma inhaler at home?
432.02205::432.78594::Patient::Yeah.
433.45345::443.82653::Doctor::OK. So what I would suggest is you take it more regularly than you are doing at the moment. Have you got, um, a spacer at home?
440.91097::441.68874::Patient::Mm-hmm.
445.89978::450.89666::Patient::Um, do you want to show me how to do it or somehow?
451.125::454.61006::Doctor::Um, do you have a spacer at home?
455.04295::455.88323::Patient::No.
456.08021::471.31893::Doctor::OK. Um, what I can do is, I can prescribe you a peak flow meter so we can check your breathing level and a spacer to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently, which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up.
471.76523::472.76523::Patient::Yeah, sure.
472.89356::479.11741::Doctor::Um, and if you increase it so you're taking it two to four puffs, like, every four hours?
479.24487::480.29236::Patient::Mm-hmm.
480.46069::491.81884::Doctor::Initially, um, if you get a high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse, you need to call us back straightaway so we can just advise you further with that.
492.23102::493.37618::Patient::OK.
493.64719::504.10982::Doctor::And it will be a good idea when you're feeling better if we can arrange just a review, just to see how your asthma is, because we may need to start some other medication for you.
504.54827::506.45239::Patient::OK, sounds good, yeah.
505.40086::512.8262::Doctor::You could arrange a review in a week or so, um, but, but before that and if you're, if you're feeling worse.
513.8142::516.02433::Patient::In a week, right? OK.
516.7217::522.78138::Doctor::OK, and the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine.
523.20289::524.07789::Patient::Mm-hmm.
523.97541::530.69179::Doctor::Which you can get from the pharmacy, I can put a on your notes about what to take.
526.84873::527.61262::Patient::Yeah.
529.95985::531.64041::Patient::Yeah, they'll be helpful.
531.78134::541.10219::Doctor::And then if you, when you get the peak flow meter, if you can take, the pharmacist can show you how to use it, and if you can record a value first thing when you wake up.
541.79322::542.66822::Patient::Mm-hmm.
541.86338::550.63225::Doctor::And in the evening over the next week, and then we can discuss that over the phone when we look at the figures and see whether you need to go on another inhaler as well.
550.8954::552.99419::Patient::Oh, awesome, thank you.
553.17719::554.84094::Doctor::Have you got any questions?
555.29841::559.90169::Patient::Um, no, that's fine, yeah, thank you very much.
559.35584::562.54986::Doctor::Thanks a lot, bye.
561.356::563.27998::Patient::
