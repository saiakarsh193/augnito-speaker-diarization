190.6167::201.15441::Doctor::OK. So, let me summarise what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago, and you experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly seven out of ten.
194.44985::194.8793::Patient::
201.72932::205.7469::Doctor::And it feels more like someone's sitting on your chest, as opposed to pain.
201.73421::202.18206::Patient::Yeah.
206.26147::207.77628::Patient::Yes, that's great.
208.24372::213.47073::Doctor::And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual, specifically with your breathing?
216.83001::224.56898::Patient::Uh, yes I have. Um, I've got shortness of breath. And I feel slightly, light-headed.
226.61889::228.76845::Doctor::OK, and is that getting worse or better?
231.73145::245.98765::Patient::Um, it's remained the same. Although, I would say recently I've noticed, in terms of sort of breathing, I've had, some difficulty climbing the stairs. And, if I have to sort of walk uphill, there's that sort of challenge as well.
246.36528::252.13101::Doctor::And when you get short of breath, when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain?
255.18141::262.02584::Patient::Um, no pain as such, but there's often calf pain and, leg swellings.
262.8244::268.69205::Doctor::OK. So, let me confirm. You have the pressure at the moment, and you have shortness of breath, is that correct?
268.67865::269.68674::Patient::That is correct, yes.
269.27892::276.43982::Doctor::. So, given what you've told me about your past medical history. I think it might be worth, you calling an ambulance.
276.83809::277.58042::Patient::OK.
277.27218::284.10378::Doctor::get you to the hospital as soon as possible. Because, my concern is, it might be something to do with your heart.

285.29957::286.75205::Patient::Ohh, OK.
292.11572::292.75375::Patient::Ohh right.
292.57614::299.98251::Doctor::But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone. So I can gather some more information, that we can give to the paramedics. Is that OK?
297.20775::297.85628::Patient::OK.
300.81645::303.53852::Patient::Um, should I, be concerned about anything?
304.06596::314.64558::Doctor::It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but, given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and you've got some chest pain. I'm always worried about the heart first, before anything else.
314.0249::316.29556::Patient::, OK, .
315.31628::319.16622::Doctor::, and we, and we need to look after your heart before anything else.
321.08227::327.33311::Doctor::So, apart from this light-headedness, and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual?
331.39456::336.87669::Patient::Um, nothing, else unusual. Um, I'm not sure if I spoke to you about nausea?
337.29249::340.39219::Patient::I've noticed nausea, but no vomiting, yet.
340.05019::342.33146::Doctor::Did you have anything to eat or drink this morning?
342.44252::343.35529::Patient::Um, no.
344.68459::347.30714::Doctor::And you feel, still feel nauseous at the moment?
347.93306::349.65183::Patient::I have, yeah. I am, yeah.
350.34364::356.48768::Doctor::So, I have a couple of other questions to ask you, and I'm gonna reel them off. So, apologies for not letting you talk very much.
354.57627::355.18976::Patient::OK.
356.84274::357.79526::Patient::No, that's fine.
357.50982::360.87479::Doctor::Have you noticed this pressure, radiating to your head?
361.71454::363.44442::Patient::Uh, not to my head, no.
363.42549::365.85046::Doctor::And how about to your left, or right arm?
366.63364::371.32361::Patient::Uh, yes. There is some pain in my left shoulder and arm.
372.01747::375.64588::Doctor::And does that pain go anywhere else? To your left arm, or to your back?

391.19171::392.851::Patient::Uh, no problems going to the loo.
394.32105::398.1171::Doctor::And you're normally fit and well, apart from the two things you told me about?
398.6812::399.67564::Patient::Um.
400.45485::415.52281::Patient::Yes, however, there's some problems just, performing daily activities. Um, like I said, with the difficulties climbing up the stairs and going uphill. Um, I try to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, nothing too strenuous.
414.3068::414.83979::Doctor::
417.47849::419.8933::Doctor::And, do you live at home with your wife at the moment?
