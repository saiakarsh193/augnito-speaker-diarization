358.77445::361.0969::Patient::Yeah it's really stressful, actually.

396.90904::403.49616::Doctor::Yeah? OK. Um do you smoke at all? and do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
400.57923::401.04107::Patient::No.
403.77359::404.29716::Patient::No.
404.39423::411.50186::Doctor::OK, alright. Um, so normally at this I'd like to kind of proceed to examination. Um
411.50186::422.25998::Doctor::That's um based on your story, um I wonder whether you may, uh may have a migraine, uh migraine type headache. Uh it sounds
422.25998::434.89093::Doctor::Um, very classical of that, of that nature, the the the headache on one side, throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, um sensitivity to bright lights.
434.89093::440.7395::Doctor::Uh, I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious, such as meningitis, or indeed
440.7395::445.2313::Doctor::Brain cancer, I know that was a big worry of yours initially. Um
443.93785::457.96633::Patient::thank you, uh thanks so much. I was so worried that I had cancer. And, ohh now you say migraine. Yeah I guess my mum has similar symptoms to me and yeah, it does make sense.
455.45315::457.9461::Doctor::yeah. Yeah.
457.9461::464.82736::Doctor::Well, I hope that puts your, you know, mind at ease. Um, certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month. Um,
464.82736::473.0164::Doctor::So I think, moving forwards, there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important, uh to see exactly what's triggering these headaches.
473.0164::483.41573::Doctor::And in terms of trying to treat your headaches today, some strong painkillers would be advisable. So, think about Paracetamol, or even Co-codamol.
483.41573::488.70165::Doctor::Um, and some anti-inflammatories, such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen. How's that sound to you?
488.77344::490.22485::Patient::K that sounds good.
490.08376::503.05805::Doctor::Um and uh, you know if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we could maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place, something prophylactic medicines.
503.05805::507.15212::Doctor::then we could have a discussion next time I see you next week, perhaps.
503.24864::504.0218::Patient::OK.
506.57241::507.3::Patient::OK.
507.15212::516.31844::Doctor::OK. Um, now a couple of things I want you to think about is, you know if your symptoms aren't getting better next two three days, or indeed they're getting worse.
516.31844::522.85325::Doctor::I'd like you to come back and see me, um straight away if possible. So if your headache's getting worse, not responding to medications
522.85325::532.17178::Doctor::Or your um neck pain is getting worse, or you develop any weakness in your arms and legs, or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away. OK?
532.24994::532.96781::Patient::OK.
533.57604::534.93478::Doctor::Does that sound all OK?
535.04944::536.43066::Patient::Doctor, that's great.
536.37713::537.7219::Doctor::Great. Any questions for me?
537.88902::539.3152::Patient::No. Thank you.
539.24103::540.46893::Doctor::OK. Have a good day!
540.6348::541.58822::Patient::K thanks. Bye!
541.38898::542.29957::Doctor::Right.
