324.75068::325.5176::Patient::Yeah.
325.76267::334.16805::Doctor::What I would, suggest is, taking, uh, um, some anti-inflammatories, along with the Paracetamol.
334.98372::335.7356::Patient::OK.
335.70419::339.26959::Doctor::Um, as a. Uh, you said you're eating OK?
339.18672::340.43484::Patient::Yeah, yeah, fine.
340.12212::348.21627::Doctor::I mean it, from the sounds of it, it does, sound quite like a migraine, but obviously if you had no history of that, in the past.
348.21627::354.79955::Doctor::Um, and is anything changed recently, or any, anything you've done recently might've, triggered it?
355.31447::360.48738::Patient::Uh, not that I can think of, um, may have been a bit stressed out at work, that kind of thing, but .
357.54009::358.20926::Doctor::
359.53217::369.11147::Doctor::Yeah. Um, well that would be the first thing to do, is to take some anti-inflammatories along with the Paracetamol. Make sure you're really well hydrated.
369.11147::385.11111::Doctor::Um, and, see how that goes, and if it, if it isn't settling, or it's getting worse, or you get any other change in your headache. Um, or you're unwell with it, with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you.
385.11111::399.45516::Doctor::Straight away about that. The other thing is if you, if you're getting persistent, um, headaches, or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle, or certain things seem to trigger these headaches.
399.45516::407.35942::Doctor::Then, it, it would be worth, having a further discussion about it, to see whether we can, work out if we can help the, that longer-term.
408.01346::409.90068::Patient::OK, brilliant, thank you.
409.62257::415.15205::Doctor::Um, I would, try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked, if you haven't had it checked for a while.
415.15205::421.60307::Doctor::Uh, and, thing to do is to have a thermometer at home, so you can make sure that your temperature's OK.
415.78035::417.12621::Patient::OK, sure.
421.90063::422.50214::Patient::Yep.
423.02101::430.56885::Doctor::If you have a raised temperature or, your headache's just getting worse, or you develop any rashes or anything like that. Then we'd need to speak to you straight away.
431.81037::437.68252::Patient::Yep, OK, that's brilliant. OK, so I'll take some Ibuprofen and I'll um, hopefully, be a bit better in a day or two then, so yeah.
438.00039::440.97582::Doctor::OK, so, have you got any other questions?
441.20131::442.7577::Patient::Uh, no, that was it today.
443.3292::448.9291::Doctor::OK. OK then, we'll, we'll, we'll, um, speak to you again.
449.51707::451.08097::Patient::OK, brilliant. Thanks so much.
