375.92521::376.8425::Patient::Um.
376.31477::378.01146::Doctor::What? Could you just repeat that?
378.28611::386.90266::Patient::The ORS, the, the salt sugar ORS, um, um, mix, the salt sugar mix.
386.60407::389.50061::Doctor::OK. And how often have you been taking that?
387.61695::388.24101::Patient::Yeah.

395.73222::405.24084::Doctor::OK. Um, and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off, or getting worse, or ?
404.30869::415.63202::Patient::I, I, I they're not getting any better, 'cause like I said, I've been, I've been vomiting literally everything I take, so, so I doubt that even that had, had the chance to work.
411.62082::412.33053::Doctor::Yeah.
415.96246::416.83345::Doctor::OK.
417.98827::418.84635::Doctor::Um.
419.33028::435.07684::Doctor::I mean, it sounds like, because your brother's had a similar thing, it sounds like it might be some, an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got, which is usually caused by a virus. But, it can be from something you've eaten, as well. Um.
435.07684::449.73967::Doctor::If the symptoms, they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts. Um, if the symptoms are continuing to get worse, the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough.
450.53324::465.00899::Doctor::Um, sometimes you do require certain medication to help this, if it's, sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria. Um, what I would say, probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not starting to ease off.
465.00899::473.06618::Doctor::I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool, so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment.
473.48924::474.48924::Patient::OK.
474.54354::486.33575::Doctor::Um, and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated, because if you're, if you're not keeping fluid down, then you can get dehydrated.
487.52928::489.74848::Doctor::Um, so.
487.79001::496.54942::Patient::So, how, how do I, how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even, like, drink water? I'm throwing up everything.
496.24457::509.85592::Doctor::Yeah. So you need to carry on with your rehydration salts, and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago. So, you're obviously still, um, hydrated enough to pass urine.
506.03063::506.75244::Patient::OK.
509.85592::521.31268::Doctor::But we, um, we should see you so that we can check your hydration and, um, get that sample sent off as soon as possible.
522.0482::529.99573::Doctor::'cause if, if, if you come into the clinic, you can send that sample off straightaway. Otherwise, we would have to post it out to you which would take time.
522.22614::523.06073::Patient::OK.
530.54194::534.26375::Patient::Ohh, OK. So, when can I come to the clinic to have this done?
534.16953::553.87044::Doctor::Um, so we can, we can make you an urgent appointment, um, and then you can, you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration. Um, but if, in the meantime, you're feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A and E.
554.79009::555.65475::Patient::OK.
555.4123::558.67654::Doctor::So you can call us back in the meantime.
559.07581::573.16605::Patient::OK. So, what I'll do is, yeah. If you could, please book me the appointment and, um, yeah, I'll see how I feel, um, for the end of the day. Hopefully I don't need to go to the A and E, and, um .
571.50733::586.1379::Doctor::Yeah. If you keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salts. Just tiny sips constantly, to so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and, and you vomit, so just tiny, tiny sips but just keep going with it.
586.1379::600.6072::Doctor::Um, and just have very simple food, if you're gonna have anything, like toast or biscuit or something really light like that. Avoid, um, fruit, vegetables, uh, milk, anything like that, which might just make it worse.
593.94804::594.64728::Patient::Mm-hmm.
600.79015::601.58714::Patient::OK.
602.25873::606.15515::Doctor::OK. So you'll have to book an appointment through the support line.
603.34654::604.51947::Patient::OK.
606.34654::607.38414::Patient::Yes, please.
607.58735::609.57433::Doctor::Right, OK. We'll do that for you.
610.13602::610.73::Patient::
610.85171::612.30327::Doctor::OK, take care.
612.32399::613.22624::Patient::Thank you.
612.87752::614.1807::Doctor::Thanks, bye.
613.7977::614.63998::Patient::
