327.14853::342.39557::Patient::Well, I'm a little bit hypochondriac. So, I feel that this can be some kind of brain tumour, tumour or something? Because, I'm like this is, , really, the pain is so horrible that, or maybe a stroke. I don't know, it's, it's just like you know, you hear so many stories.

372.38599::375.63223::Patient::It's really about the head. That's why I find it very weird.
375.41402::384.85916::Doctor::OK. So, just, just to clarify what, what you said . This morning, uh, you woke up and then later on in the, in the morning, about four hours ago, you've developed a headache?

388.12244::388.79162::Patient::Yeah.
388.56135::391.23519::Doctor::Left side of the head, is it behind the eye?
389.46177::390.31842::Patient::Exactly.
392.21193::393.07524::Patient::Sorry?
392.8495::395.7903::Doctor::Is it behind the eye? Is that where the pain is?
396.24707::405.45717::Patient::Uh, no, no it's, ugh, I don't know how to describe it. But it's, just like, , kind of.
402.55717::405.16285::Doctor::Um, you've .
406.78086::414.2437::Doctor::OK. That's fine. You've noticed that your vision is blurry, there's funny lines, you feel a bit nauseous, you vomited twice.
414.2437::421.45778::Doctor::Um, and, uh, you feeling dizzy as well, but your, you've got no neurological symptoms. You're walking fine.
415.12265::415.98932::Patient::Yes.
421.45778::426.32984::Doctor::Um, and, and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped. Is that all? OK.
424.69277::425.52011::Patient::No.
426.32984::432.67525::Doctor::So, it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine. Is that something you've heard of before?
426.62802::427.13162::Patient::Yeah.
432.99873::435.96411::Patient::Uh. Uh, no, it's the first time.
435.97665::436.91168::Doctor::OK.
436.3901::440.91075::Patient::But, to be honest, I'm very familiar with the disease, because my mother has it, so.
440.91075::452.78437::Patient::Uh, well, but I never had it, and I thought that the onset of migraine will be, you know, in much, uh, early ages. So, that's why I'm not sure, if migraine makes sense. .
451.82455::462.15328::Doctor::OK. So, um, usually with, with migraines they can present at different times in people's lives, so, sometimes they can present as a child, sometimes they can present when they're older.
462.15328::466.53141::Doctor::Um, and sometimes they can present, you know, even postmenopausally.
466.53141::474.60956::Doctor::So, there's different, there's different ways you can get migraines. Uh, and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head.
474.60956::482.58306::Doctor::typical of a migraine, you've got blurry vision, again which is very typical, with the nausea and vomiting, that's also typical of a migraine.
474.94837::475.76852::Patient::Mm-hmm.
482.58306::494.96816::Doctor::Now, um, uh, obviously, if the headache is really severe, and I'll suggest some medications you can try, if that doesn't work, we would want to see you, um, as soon as possible, to do like a full neurological exam as well.
494.96816::502.45501::Doctor::to make sure that, you know, there's, you know, when we do a more specific examination that, um, everything all seems fine.
495.22012::496.60982::Patient::Ohh, that's great.
502.45501::510.71696::Doctor::Um, I I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, uh, if you take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen?
504.32649::505.03153::Patient::
507.35071::507.91186::Patient::Yeah.
511.29064::520.03316::Patient::OK. So, and, uh, you're, you're saying that if this is a migraine, and if I try that medication. This should go away, kind of, today?
519.96657::528.29735::Doctor::So, yes, a migraine, yeah, no, you know, even sooner than that, we can look at maybe half an hour to forty minutes, depending on what your response to it is, for some people,
528.29735::538.67015::Doctor::Uh, whatever medications they take the migraine doesn't improve, um, and they can last from anywhere from four hours to seventy two hours, migraines can last. Um, but .
538.10215::540.99739::Patient::Ugh. OK. That doesn't sound good.
539.40329::540.33463::Doctor::
541.38315::549.86929::Doctor::No. So, what, there's lots of medication treatments so, there's, it can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness, um, so and , which you can get from the pharmacy.
549.86929::555.24132::Doctor::Um, and you also to drink, uh, sugary and carbonated drinks, something like Coke.
555.6042::556.47785::Patient::OK.
556.19774::564.3881::Doctor::For the three of them is, uh, is a good sort of cocktail to start them, then we can go up the treatment ladder, you can get specific migraine relief medication.
564.3881::569.50122::Doctor::And that should be something to try between now and when we see you to do the, um, to do the assessment.
564.62865::565.17541::Patient::OK.
569.94952::571.2897::Patient::OK. Sounds.
570.45393::574.18544::Doctor::assessment to where we can see you today at some point.
574.52776::575.41984::Patient::OK.
575.47532::584.93711::Doctor::And, but however, if you do take these medications and, you know, by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself, you can cancel it, um, you can give us a call and cancel it.
585.18285::588.72573::Patient::OK, sounds good, yeah. Sounds, sounds a good plan.
586.68135::587.19204::Doctor::OK.
