777.17251::792.6969::Doctor::Um, if you are, if you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular Paracetamol would be beneficial. Um, you mentioned feeling a bit short of breath. Um, I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but what we could think about is giving you a.
783.81255::784.53982::Patient::Aye.
792.6969::799.18275::Doctor::A script for antibiotics, which maybe use in next, twenty four to forty eight hours, if your symptoms don't get better.

808.55919::820.78401::Doctor::Yeah, , I will, yeah, I'll, I'll give you a script today, give it about twenty four to forty eight hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and, run-down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like Amoxicillin.
820.78401::827.65471::Doctor::One tablet, three times a day. Um, uh, and , if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me, we can have another look.
