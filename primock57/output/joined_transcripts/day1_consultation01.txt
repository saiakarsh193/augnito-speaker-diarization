276.06988::277.06988::Patient::Yeah.
279.13558::290.17474::Patient::Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.
285.07128::286.07128::Doctor::Okay.
288.56378::289.56378::Doctor::Yeah.
290.36973::293.33985::Doctor::And have you, are you currently working at the moment?

311.21382::312.21382::Patient::Yes, yeah.
311.75754::316.3254::Doctor::Right, alright. Um, just a couple of other question we need to ask, sir. Um, do you smoke at all?

318.01119::319.98133::Doctor::And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
320.2922::324.351::Patient::Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no.
322.64977::348.91382::Doctor::Okay. so um, er normally at this stage I like to um, examine you if that's okay, but um, um, but but having listened to your story, sir, I think uh, um, just to recap for the last three days you've been having loose stool, diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain uh mainly on the left-hand side, um and vomiting and fever and you're quite weak and lethargic um, you mentioned you had this Chinese takeaway as little as three days ago and I wondered whether that might be the cause of your problems.
330.07645::331.07645::Patient::Yeah.
343.07637::344.07637::Patient::
348.42928::349.42928::Patient::Okay.
348.91382::358.64794::Doctor::Um, it seems like you may have something, uh, called gastroenteritis, which essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your uh of your tummy.
352.93906::353.93906::Patient::
358.64794::367.96927::Doctor::Uh, mainly caused by viruses but there can be a possibility of bacteria uh causing its symptoms. Um.
358.66452::359.66452::Patient::Yeah.
366.70368::367.70368::Patient::Yeah.
368.83739::381.08066::Doctor::At this stage, uh, what, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So, um, I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just, um, making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids.
373.50756::374.50756::Patient::
379.70361::380.70361::Patient::Mm-hmm.
381.58198::392.06135::Doctor::Um, there are things like Dioralyte you can get from the pharmacy, which uh it's um it helps helps replenish your minerals and vitamins.
391.76236::392.76236::Patient::Okay.
392.06135::397.34647::Doctor::Um, and if you are having vomiting diarrhea I would say recommend that in the first, you know, first couple of days.
397.15448::398.15448::Patient::Yep.
397.34647::406.32722::Doctor::If you are feeling feverish and weak, eh taking some paracetamol, uh, two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help.
402.38974::403.38974::Patient::Yep.
406.32722::417.77954::Doctor::I will certainly advise you to take some time off work, actually I know you're quite keen to work but I would say the next two, two to three days as the infection clears from your system to take some time off and rest.
409.50735::410.50735::Patient::Okay.
413.58576::414.58576::Patient::Yeah.
417.77954::425.30126::Doctor::Um, I'll admit if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in in three to four days, I'd like to come and see you again.
424.70334::425.70334::Patient::Okay, sure.
425.30126::429.2709::Doctor::Because if it is ongoing then we have to wonder whether something else caused your symptoms.
429.19351::430.19351::Patient::Yep.
429.2709::435.38876::Doctor::Uh, and we may need to do further tests like um taking a sample of your stool so we can test that.
434.42877::435.42877::Patient::
435.38876::437.80648::Doctor::Um, etcetera etcetera.
437.87973::438.87973::Patient::Yep, sure, yep.
439.12608::440.12608::Doctor::How's that sound?
440.36991::442.09539::Patient::That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.
441.5694::443.38383::Doctor::Do you have any questions for me?
443.80126::446.82086::Patient::Um, no, no further questions, no.
446.45245::448.98129::Doctor::Okay, and is uh is the treatment plan clear?
449.39454::452.07573::Patient::Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.
452.06427::453.52581::Doctor::Great. Well, I wish you all the best.
453.46787::456.17374::Patient::Okay, thank you. Bye.
