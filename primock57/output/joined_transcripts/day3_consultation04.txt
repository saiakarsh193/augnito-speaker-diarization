314.41665::314.93404::Patient::Mm-hmm.
319.6759::324.94867::Doctor::In the interim, what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when.
324.94867::338.92704::Doctor::OK. You can use it maximum about every two to four, four hours, but if you're using it that often that means pretty much that, you know, your asthma is really bad. You can use it, but that's not ideal.
325.64389::326.2236::Patient::Mm-hmm.
338.92704::343.21206::Doctor::But uh, the brown your Clenil. The brown inhaler.

343.21206::351.06566::Doctor::You can up the dose. If you're using just three puffs twice a day, you can increase it to four puffs twice a day.
351.06566::356.04148::Doctor::Yeah. And while, this is to do while you're waiting to see us.
351.46989::352.22352::Patient::Mm-hmm.
356.04148::368.83127::Doctor::Now, I've mentioned, you know, you're doing you know, increase the, uh, Clenil to four puffs twice a day and you're using the asthma, you know, the blue inhalers every two to four hours.
356.82495::357.47713::Patient::OK.
368.83127::375.67479::Doctor::And your breathing is getting really worse, then you would need to take yourself to A and E. You shouldn't wait for our appointment.
375.67479::381.52508::Doctor::OK. So, when you'd opt to sneeze you, what we're going to do is we're gonna examine your chest, yeah.
376.96256::377.44082::Patient::Yeah.
381.52508::388.73982::Doctor::Make you do the peak flow reading. So depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics and some steroids.
382.6437::383.14371::Patient::Yeah.
388.73982::396.68943::Doctor::But anyway, while you're at home, we're going to by increasing your Clenil, we are increasing your steroid intake anyway.
