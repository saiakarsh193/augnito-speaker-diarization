266.95951::276.6118::Patient::On the, on the tip of the elbow, it's, it's OK, just like, next to it like where the, the swelling is, it's a bit, yeah it feels weird.
277.02404::285.63311::Doctor::OK. All right. Um, well, um, I noticed the skin was a bit dry, , on the tip of the elbow. Do you, do you have dry skin anywhere else on the body?

293.55796::294.76849::Doctor::No. Alright.
296.09931::301.55754::Doctor::OK. So um, what I think we should do, with regards to your elbow problem
301.55754::313.67065::Doctor::OK. Is um, I think, it would be worthwhile. , this seems like uh, what we call the Bursitis. OK. So, that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint.
313.67065::321.25681::Doctor::Um, what I think we should do is, I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication, in the, in the first instance.
319.14853::320.14853::Patient::OK.
321.25681::329.66972::Doctor::And, as well as that, what I would like to do, is to get some blood tests done, to check for other types of uh, causes of joint swelling. K?
325.35149::326.35149::Patient::Alright.
329.66972::341.12655::Doctor::So, um, what we're going to do is, we're going to arrange some, um, blood test forms to be sent out to your house. And, there'll be instructions within that pack, about where to go to get those blood tests done.
341.12655::351.05783::Doctor::And, that will involve you, um, having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies.
341.52559::343.27922::Patient::
351.05783::356.82149::Doctor::So we'll do a full screen, and also check for things like Gout as well, OK. Um.
355.39531::356.39531::Patient::OK.
356.82149::364.12303::Doctor::The time frame for that, will be um, the results will come back to us after about five or six days. Um.
363.83018::367.75776::Patient::K . O
364.12303::374.2305::Doctor::From now, but it may take time for the form to come out to you. And if you get the form get the blood tests done straight away, by the time that we're expecting result back, you know one or two days after that, we're looking maybe six days.
374.2305::386.37317::Doctor::And, what I would suggest, is, we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you, in one of our clinics, where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood test.
374.45348::375.59841::Patient::OK.
386.37317::392.8969::Doctor::Uh, we can um, get a gauge as to, uh, what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now,
393.8969::402.68642::Doctor::It doesn't look like, to me that's something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So, we're worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint.
398.4103::399.67117::Patient::Mm-hmm.
404.16763::408.28418::Doctor::Um, and uh, your, your joint doesn't look like that.
404.43411::405.17846::Patient::Yeah.
408.28418::422.10516::Doctor::However, if your, the elbow was to become very red, very painful, uh, and the redness was to spread or become uh, you know more intense. Then you need to get on the phone or get, have a video appointment , with one of us as soon as possible.
421.88882::423.03375::Patient::OK.
422.10516::427.81439::Doctor::'Cause that would be an emergency. That would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment. OK?
427.46858::436.12085::Patient::do you, do you think it's something dangerous? Like something, like could I die from that, or is it, is it
435.19274::449.7719::Doctor::No. I, I don't think this is anything dangerous. don't need to worry. OK? What I'm doing, is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to, to develop. K? So, , this, this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward.
438.16435::439.16435::Patient::OK.
444.42527::445.84557::Patient::Yeah, OK, I see.
449.7719::461.87092::Doctor::It's nothing , sinister or life-threatening. Um, what I'm doing is I'm just saying, in case things worsen, these are the things that we'd be looking out for, and this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully, and I don't think you're going to have it.
457.41093::458.41093::Patient::OK.
461.87092::465.33341::Doctor::But I'm just saying, the what if scenario. Is that OK?
465.07767::467.67189::Patient::Yeah that, that sounds good. Thank you.
467.43116::470.2808::Doctor::All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me?
470.5125::482.06336::Patient::Um, well just yeah I just wanted to know about this. Um, yeah it feels a bit better now . Uh, but yeah, no that's it. Thank you.
478.2207::480.26602::Doctor::OK, all right. Um.
481.60416::495.44635::Doctor::OK. So, I, I would take Ibuprofen regularly, OK. You can get that , over the counter. Um, that's four hundred milligrams, two times a day. And you should take, take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it. OK.
485.32426::485.98864::Patient::OK.
495.48379::497.81714::Patient::Sure. thanks. Bye.
496.29598::499.31457::Doctor::All right. So, what I wanna do is, I'll get the forms sent out to you.
499.31457::502.99547::Doctor::And, um, we are going to arrange a, a follow-up appointment.
502.99547::516.92768::Doctor::Maybe within a um, actually you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face, if it's more convenient for you do, to do it over the phone, we can do that over the phone, uh, over video. We can do that as well, that's, that's your call. But you contact us, , after you've had the blood test done, and we can review things then, OK.
510.17961::511.17961::Patient::OK.
516.94681::524.04932::Patient::OK, yeah that sounds good. I, I'll do that. And if I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for a physical appointment.
523.58937::535.71316::Doctor::Sure, sure that's a good idea. All right then, OK. Um, take care then. So , look just leave that with me, I'll sort all those bits and pieces out, and then we'll get them sent out to you, and then we'll, we'll um, review you after the tests, things goes well, OK.
528.0972::528.75297::Patient::
534.7016::537.57119::Patient::Thank you. Alright. Sounds
536.52651::538.89774::Doctor::All right then. Take care then, all the best. Bye bye.
538.81179::539.40577::Patient::Bye.
