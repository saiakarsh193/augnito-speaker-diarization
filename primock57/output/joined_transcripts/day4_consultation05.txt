266.38745::275.0517::Patient::No, no, just there, and it, it seems to be alleviate a bit, toilet, and maybe it's like trapped gas. So, I don't know what it is, but.

281.1904::290.68677::Patient::I think it was this morning. This morning, I, but the, the thing is like, because I'm not eating anything now. So, I, I haven't vomited again.

332.18207::333.18207::Doctor::
337.96628::347.05502::Doctor::OK. And, um, did you eat anything that you think might of been bad, or anything that could have caused the tummy pain?
339.70148::340.70148::Patient::Yeah, .
347.07375::364.76303::Patient::Uh, I, I don't know. To be honest, sometimes I have, when I get a bit of anxiety, I, I use my inhaler. And, but my inhaler kind of um, run out the one. Because you know, I'm a foreigner, so I have uh, this brand, but I bought a new one here.
355.44842::356.59843::Doctor::Yeah.
363.89452::365.2573::Doctor::. OK.
364.76303::370.91323::Patient::And, uh, I don't know maybe this new one has cause it, this, this problem. I don't know.
368.74015::369.93052::Doctor::OK.
371.41973::390.14695::Doctor::OK. It's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain, like this. Normally, it's when you eat, um, bad food or food that has gone off, and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested. But just to double-check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing?
376.26361::377.26361::Patient::Mmm.
381.12493::382.12493::Patient::Uh-huh.
390.92047::405.48265::Patient::Um, uh, I, I always have problems with my breathing, because of the asthma like, . When I, , I need to use my inhaler a little bit, but apart of the normal, I haven't, I haven't.
396.87316::397.87316::Doctor::OK.
405.1466::409.95958::Doctor::OK. And how about chest, have you noticed any chest pain?
408.70163::413.00746::Patient::, no, I haven't , I haven't noticed any chest pain.
412.88765::418.21862::Doctor::OK. And how about, um, walking and talking, are those all both OK?
418.55899::433.26374::Patient::Uh, walking and talking, uh, yes, yes. Uh, I, I, but uh, but yeah I don't walk very far because uh, I, yeah I need to, I need to go to the toilet now and then. So, I'm spending some time at home.
431.96173::436.40581::Doctor::Yep. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain?
436.92068::438.7382::Patient::Ohh, it does a little bit.
438.70333::439.68522::Doctor::OK.
444.52933::447.01018::Doctor::Sorry, I was just writing some things down.
447.81121::448.81121::Patient::Sure.
449.59293::461.33556::Doctor::So, what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad, and it's causing your tummy pain. And it's , this is normally called gastroenteritis, so, an infection of the tummy.
456.05941::457.1324::Patient::OK.
461.57766::463.07402::Patient::Ohh, OK.
462.67216::482.4349::Doctor::Normally, when patients have this do some things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids, because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers, so, if you start getting a temperature then you need .
474.08864::475.08864::Patient::
480.57041::481.57041::Patient::Mmm, OK.
483.92807::484.92807::Patient::Uh-huh.
483.96728::489.12559::Doctor::And please stay home for the time being until you get slightly better.
490.45363::494.00838::Patient::OK. OK, I, yeah.
491.56445::493.24072::Doctor::And normally,
494.32822::499.01053::Doctor::Normally, things like antibiotics don't help, they make the situation worse.
500.10329::518.89896::Patient::OK. I didn't, yeah, sorry I didn't. No, I was saying I didn't have any, fever recently. I, I was sweating a little bit the last four days, but I, I. Not sure if, if I had bit of fever, but very, little or, or, I'm, I'm but I don't think so, I don't think. I don't know maybe.
500.84507::502.16162::Doctor::So, that's.
503.01773::504.16162::Doctor::Go ahead.
519.57901::532.06112::Doctor::So, I think that's what we should do for the time being, if you feel you're getting much worse, than I would suggest you go and see your GP in real, in real life, in person, so they can loot at your belly.
520.19093::521.19093::Patient::
530.07416::531.07416::Patient::OK.
532.23475::541.36616::Patient::OK, I will, yeah I will book then, book , I will wait a couple of days to see, or one more day, and then I will book, and then, yeah.
539.42088::543.83098::Doctor::Great! Cool! Do you have any more questions for me?
543.72382::556.2713::Patient::Uh, , no, that's uh, that's it. I was maybe just concerned about my father's uh, medical history, that would uh, I could be at some kind of risk.
553.83825::554.83825::Doctor::Yes.
556.19914::571.32758::Doctor::So, the, the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had, but if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look up from the GP.
566.17643::567.17643::Patient::OK.
571.98334::581.41004::Patient::OK, OK. Yeah, that sounds good, that sounds good. OK. Thank you very much doctor, for your time. Bye bye.
572.90313::574.31897::Doctor::Does that sound OK?
576.58328::577.85998::Doctor::Thank you .
579.72636::581.06862::Doctor::Bye bye.
