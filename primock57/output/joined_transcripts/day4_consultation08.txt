52.19533::57.41336::Patient::Yeah, um. So basically it's, just been happening over the last few weeks or so.
58.65396::66.65393::Patient::But I don't really feel like um, like, getting up in the morning's really difficult, and I don't have much energy at all, during the day, um.

104.10794::112.54512::Doctor::And that's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three or five? how many hours of sleep?
110.08103::121.96271::Patient::Actually, well, now I kind of think about it maybe, maybe even longer, um. I guess uh, , might be related to, so I also started a new job, um, slightly recently.
121.96271::129.14244::Patient::Um. It might of even coincided, coincided with uh, with that, job, a couple of months ago.
129.23168::131.55146::Doctor::When did you start your new job? Two months ago, did you say?

153.98533::161.03726::Doctor::Is there anything that you're particularly, sort of concerned about, um, or hoping to get out of this consultation?
161.80938::171.85992::Patient::Well, um, I, I know that it's not really normal for me, so, before this phase. So I'd have thing, you know I wouldn't have, uh, any problems sort of.
171.85992::180.86183::Patient::, eating, what I want to eat, or you know, doing standard things in life, and, and, what I want, to do is just like, kind of return to that previous state.
180.86183::189.37529::Patient::Uh, somehow. Um, I'm not sure how that is. Uh, what, what the best ways of doing that are, but, yeah. Do you have some advice or?
187.15427::187.86056::Doctor::

192.0352::204.9747::Doctor::OK. Sure. OK. Um, well what would I like to do is just ask you a few more, sort of questions around what's been going on, um, and also around your background health and um, and things like that.
204.9747::208.36688::Doctor::And then we can go on to sort of what can be done from there. Is that alright?

222.57818::235.42025::Patient::Um, actually I'm, just uh, not, not really waking up early. It's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all, really. I think that's probably closer.

645.51805::655.92406::Doctor::I would like to, probably see you in person, and do an examination. And, and also, we would probably like to do some blood tests um, as well.
655.92406::668.58759::Doctor::So, do you think it would be possible to see uh, to to book an appointment in the next few days uh, with your GP? Or, or um, that would be ideal, I think here.
668.58759::677.95999::Doctor::Um, and then we can, we can probably do some more uh, we'll do an examination and uh, do some investigations really, to see what's going on here a little bit more.
670.10952::671.14923::Patient::, yes.
678.55232::679.712::Patient::That makes sense, yeah.

692.47358::697.07104::Doctor::Uh, but we've at least started the ball rolling with um, some further investigations and tests.
697.07104::705.26994::Doctor::I'm glad you're, you know, you're, you're , you're, although you have a low mood, um, you're, you're, um, you're not feeling suicidal, just to confirm that.
705.01266::706.60664::Patient::Mm-hmm, yes.
705.26994::714.97419::Doctor::And, and you're, uh, and uh, we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some your tiredness, and your other symptoms, when we see you. OK?
